## Sims 4 Tracker

This website is for my personal use when playing the sims. I plan to have different dice rollers to determine certain aspects of my sims life and save results in a database. Sims relationships between each others will be save has well with hope in the future to add a family tree. 
This tracker is inspired by the 'Decade Challenge' where you play year by year your sims life stating from 1800, and by players having royal saves with different kingdoms as I will too.

I am using nexdt.js and supabase for my database.
